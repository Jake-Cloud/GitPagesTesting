                    &emsp; The goal of this project is to create an educational website that can be used to teach cybersecurity
                    basics. In order to acomplish this goal, we plan to create two websites. The first is an informational
                    website where users can find information about different cybersecurity threats and how to mitigate them.
                    The second is a hands-on experience that the user will deploy using docker. In this hands-on server, users
                    will be able to learn how different attacks are executed against an actual webserver.

                <p>
                    Our motivation for creating this project is that we believe there is currently a lack of knowledge and
                    awareness about cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This lack of knowledge can lead to applications and websites having easily
                    preventable vulnerabilities present. Our project looks to address these issues by providing an
                    environment for users to both learn about threats, and practice their skills both executing and
                    fixing vulnerabilities.

                    <p>
                        There are 3 types of users that we are targeting for our project. First, students will be able to use our project
                        to learn the basics of cybersecurity and get hands-on practice. Specifically, we are targeting cybersecurity and computer science
                        students who we think would have the most to learn from this project. Second, we believe that this project will be able to serve
                        as an effective teaching tool for teachers. They can use this project to show different types of vulnerabilities in a practical 
                        application. Finally, professional developers will be able to use this project to brush up their knowledge, or learn new skills.

                        Our informational website will host information pretaining to the vulnerabilities implemented on the hands-on webserver.
                        This information will include what the vulnerabilities are, how to exploit them, and ways to mitigate or fix them. The
                        for this site to be used as a learning tool for users to gain more knowledge about different types of attacks. Along with
                        this we have a stretch goal to implement a backend server that connects to the hands-on server and will keep track of exploited
                        vulnerabilities on a user's profiles.

                    <p>
                        The hands-on webserver will allow users to test out how different vulnerabilities work. This webserver will emulate
                        a hospital's website, with a login page, doctor search page, and bill payment page. We are aiming for this webserver
                        to be running on a cluster of docker containers that will allow us to dynamic configuration of the servers. This would allow
                        for different vulnerabilities to be generated on the server based on which seed is used.
